Most AI video tools are a prompt box behind a paywall. This is a **production
workstation**: a macOS-style desktop app (Electron + React) where the script,
the director treatment, the storyboard, the generated shots, the timeline, the
grade and the export live in one project folder you own. Bring your own keys
for fal.ai, Replicate, Gemini, xAI, ElevenLabs and Runway; route every shot to
the model that is actually best for it; keep everything local.

If it helps you make something, **please star the repo**. Stars are how other
filmmakers and developers find it.

## Why people use it

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **One production loop** | Script → Director pass → Concept & casting → Storyboard → Filming → Review → Edit → Color → Deliver, with a Studio Agent that can run phases for you. |
| **Best model per shot** | Pick a model, or choose **Auto** and let the studio route people to Nano Banana / GPT Image 2, creatures to Krea 2, environments to Seedream 5 Pro, typography to Ideogram, dialogue to Veo 3.1, performance to Kling v3, action and long takes to Seedance 2.5. |
| **Real post tools** | DaVinci-style page bar (Media, Cut, Edit, Fusion, Color, Fairlight, Deliver), colour wheels baked into 3D LUTs, waveform and histogram scopes, offline auto-cut (silence, scenes, filler words). |
| **3D previs** | Turn a reference image into a 3D blockout (Hunyuan3D v3, Trellis 2, Rodin 2.5), keyframe camera moves, render them as motion references for video generation. Scene maps flip into 3D with prefab houses, cameras, lights and characters. |
| **Boards and research** | PureRef/Miro-style infinite moodboard with sticky notes and connectors, a knowledge graph over your research sources, an Apple Photos-style library across projects. |
| **Local and open** | GPL-3.0 core, projects are plain folders, keys stay on your machine. Plugins install straight from GitHub. |

## 30-second tour

```text
Script -> Director pass -> Concept & casting -> Storyboard -> AI filming
       -> Continuity review -> Re-film queue -> Edit / Color / Sound -> Deliver
```

1. **Choose a format** in the Project hub (feature, short, microdrama 9:16,
   commercial, music video, documentary, social). It sets aspect ratio, look and
   casting defaults for every generator.
2. **Write or generate the script**, run **Analyze Script** to extract
   characters, locations and props.
3. **Director pass** turns the script into a shot list with cinematic
   direction; **Concept** casts characters and environments.
4. **Storyboard** and **Filming** generate frames and clips, with continuity
   checks and a re-film queue.
5. **Edit, Color, Fairlight, Deliver** finish the cut, with the Studio Agent
   able to run the loop for you.

## What is new (September 2026)

- macOS-style shell: source-list sidebar, slim toolbar, activity center with
  progress for every running job, dark and light themes.
- Project hub rebuilt: sticky action bars per phase, production formats,
  trimmed Story Bible, a separate Team workspace.
- Auto model choice for images and video based on what the shot shows.
- New engines: Seedance 2.5 (T2V, I2V, Omni), Seedream 5.0 Pro (+Edit), Krea 2,
  Ideogram 4, GPT Image 2; Runway Ruby SDR→HDR; Hunyuan3D v3, Trellis 2, Rodin
  2.5 for image-to-3D.
- Color page with lift/gamma/gain/offset wheels, scopes and `.cube` export;
  DaVinci-style page bar across the post pages.
- Offline auto-cut (adaptive silence removal, scene detection, filler words),
  PureRef/Miro moodboard, knowledge graph, plugin installer, scene map 3D.

Bring your own keys; the app stores them locally. Model APIs move quickly, so
adapters are maintained integration points rather than permanent contracts.

## Quick start

**Just want the app?** Download the newest installer from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LudwigKienle/ai-video-production-editor/releases/latest)
(signed macOS `.dmg`, Windows `.exe`), open it, add at least one provider key
in Settings, choose a project folder.

**Developers:**

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional overrides
npm run dev                  # browser studio at http://localhost:5173/studio.html
npm run electron:dev         # desktop app against the dev server
npm run build:web            # production web build
npm run electron:build       # distributable desktop packages
```

Requirements: Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+, npm 10+, Python 3 for the optional local
audio tools. Local project storage, folder pickers and some integrations need
the Electron app; the browser build is for development and previews.

Checks before a release:

```bash
npm test
npm run check:public-release
npm run check:public-release:strict
```

Screenshots in this README are generated with
`node scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs` against the dev server.

## Contributing

Good first areas: model adapters when APIs change, UI polish, one documented
end-to-end workflow, Node Space templates, focused tests around utilities,
translations.

## Releases and desktop builds

Installers are published on GitHub Releases, never committed to the tree.
Pushing a version tag such as `v0.1.0-open-source` runs
`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`, which builds a signed and notarized
macOS `.dmg` and a Windows `.exe` and attaches both to the release. Public tag
releases need these GitHub Actions secrets: `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`,
`MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`,
`APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Encode a certificate with `base64 -i cert.p12 | pbcopy`.

## Configuration and privacy

- Provider keys are entered in the app and stored locally. `.env.local` is for
  development, hosted features and build signing only.
- Never commit `.env`, certificates, private keys, release builds or provider
  credentials; `.env.example` holds placeholder names only.
- Hosted billing and proxy features require your own Supabase and Stripe
  projects. Provider usage is billed by the provider unless you route it through
  your own credit system.

## Open-source model, license and branding

The editor core is GPL-3.0-or-later; see [LICENSE](LICENSE), [NOTICE](NOTICE)
and [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md). Hosted services, managed credits, cloud rendering,
team sync and support can be built around the open core without putting the
local app behind a paywall. The package is marked `private` only to prevent
accidental npm publication.

Forks must keep copyright and license notices and may not present themselves as
the official release; see [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md).

## Example AI Filmmaking Workflow

A practical AI video production workflow can be organized into the following steps:

1. **Start with a script** — Define the story, scenes, dialogue, and required shots.
2. **Create a Director treatment** — Establish the visual direction, tone, and style of the project.
3. **Create character and environment references** — Define important visual details before generating shots.
4. **Build the storyboard** — Plan the composition, camera angles, and sequence of each shot.
5. **Generate video shots** — Create the individual shots using the available AI video generation tools.
6. **Review continuity** — Check character appearance, environments, props, camera position, and other visual details between shots.
7. **Re-film inconsistent shots** — Regenerate shots that introduce unwanted changes or continuity problems.
8. **Assemble the final sequence** — Select the best generated shots and arrange them into the final timeline.
9. **Export the project** — Review the completed sequence and export the final video.
